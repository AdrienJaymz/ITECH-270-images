            <h3>Mexico</h3>
            <p>I went to Cancun and got to relax at the beach. The beach was nice, nice white sand with a nice cold drink and the and the cool sea breeze blowing. The resort we stayed at was really nice too, it was called The Royal Sands All Suites Resort and Spa.</p>

            <h3>Japan</h3>
            <p>I went to go hike up Mount Fuji in Japan. It was a difficult hike, but the view at the end of the hike was well worth it. I spread the hike in two days and rested in a halfway hut on the Yoshida Trail. It kind of felt like the decent was more difficult then the ascent because of the steep slopes and the loose rocks.</p>

            <h3>Iceland</h3>
            <p>I went to the Iceland and stayed at the The Retreat at Blue Lagoon. It was really cool to see and be in the Blue Lagoon hot spring. It technically isnt a natural hot spring though, its man made from a nearby Geothermal power plant. The water has a really nice color blue.</p>

            <h3>United Arab Emirates</h3>
            <p>I went to Dubai and just wandered around. I stayed in the beautiful Atlantis The Palm. While there I did the Dubai helicopter experience to go sightseeing and see most of Dubai from a different point of view. After that I got to have dinner on the 125th floor at the Burj Khalifa.</p>
